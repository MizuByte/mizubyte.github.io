      "text": "Young gamers in Japan are growing up with far less connection to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest than previous generations. The main reason is simple: today’s mainline games take much longer to release. A new numbered Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest now often arrives after 7–10 years. That means a child can complete all six years of elementary school without ever experiencing a fresh main entry in either series during their childhood. In earlier decades, both franchises released usually every 1–3 years. Kids would play a new game every couple of years as they progressed through school, building strong memories and deep attachment that lasted into adulthood. Via: automatonwest",

      "text": "Young gamers in Japan are growing up with far less connection to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest than previous generations. The main reason is simple: today’s mainline games take much longer to release. A new numbered Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest now often arrives after 7–10 years. That means a child can complete all six years of elementary school without ever experiencing a fresh main entry in either series during their childhood. In earlier decades, both franchises released usually every 1–3 years. Kids would play a new game every couple of years as they progressed through school, building strong memories and deep attachment that lasted into adulthood. Via: automatonwest",
