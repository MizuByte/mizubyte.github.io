Stussy Sama - Dawn&Dusk (@DawnStussy) 【The Possibility of Gear 6】 Kaido says: ‘If his rubber starts affecting other things, then you could say that’s Paramecia awakening. But something feels off.

Stussy Sama - Dawn&Dusk (@DawnStussy) 【The Possibility of Gear 6】 Kaido says: ‘If his rubber starts affecting other things, then you could say that’s Paramecia awakening. But something feels off. Transformations like that are supposed to be the specialty of Zoan types.’ From this, we can understand that the Nika Devil Fruit seems to possess traits of both a Zoan and a Paramecia.
