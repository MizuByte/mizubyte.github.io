      "text": "Young gamers in Japan are growing up with far less connection to Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest than previous generations. The main reason is simple: today’s mainline games take much longer to release. A new numbered Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest now often arrives after 7–10 years. That means a child can complete all six years of elementary school without ever experiencing a fresh main entry in either series during their childhood. In earlier decades, both franchises released usually every 1–3 years. Kids would play a new game every couple of years as they progressed through school, building strong memories and deep attachment that lasted into adulthood. Via: automatonwest",

      "text": "【A deeper analysis from a native Japanese perspective】 This time, the chapter title is “The Strongest Thing in the World.” At first glance, the immediate impression is Loki. Just hearing that phrase, it could even sound like a jab at Kaido, who was known as the “strongest creature.” But there’s another meaning to this title that I’d like to focus on. In Japanese, when you use hiragana in places where kanji would normally be used, it can create a childlike tone. So writing it as “せかいで一番つよいもの” instead of using kanji gives it a softer, more childlike feeling. Because of that, this title may actually be written from the perspective of a child in Elbaph. For someone like Colon, that might mean Ripley; for someone like Bjorn, it might mean someone like Road — in other words, the person who feels strongest to them: a parent or someone close in their family. So the title could also be expressing that idea from a child’s point of view.",

The main reason is simple: today’s mainline games take much longer to release. A new numbered Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest now often arrives after 7–10 years. That means a child can complete all six years of elementary school without ever experiencing a fresh main entry in either series during their childhood. In earlier decades, both franchises released usually every 1–3 years. Kids would play a new game every couple of years as they progressed through school, building strong memories and deep attachment that lasted into adulthood. Via: automatonwest",

      "text": "【A deeper analysis from a native Japanese perspective】 This time, the chapter title is “The Strongest Thing in the World.” At first glance, the immediate impression is Loki. Just hearing that phrase, it could even sound like a jab at Kaido, who was known as the “strongest creature.” But there’s another meaning to this title that I’d like to focus on. In Japanese, when you use hiragana in places where kanji would normally be used, it can create a childlike tone. So writing it as “せかいで一番つよいもの” instead of using kanji gives it a softer, more childlike feeling. Because of that, this title may actually be written from the perspective of a child in Elbaph. For someone like Colon, that might mean Ripley; for someone like Bjorn, it might mean someone like Road — in other words, the person who feels strongest to them: a parent or someone close in their family. So the title could also be expressing that idea from a child’s point of view.",
