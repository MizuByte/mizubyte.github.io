      "text": "#ONEPIECE1174 Well, the only kanji in the WSJ title version is “1番” (ichiban – “number one”), and now the official version says it’s supposed to be written in pure hiragana—“いちばん.” This makes it much simpler, as if it were written from a child’s perspective. In my initial explanation, I focused on the “mono” (もの) part of the chapter title because it was written in hiragana instead of kanji. In Japanese, “mono” can be written using two different kanji: “物” (for non-living things) and “者” (for a person). I think it was intended that way to make the meaning ambiguous (and I still think it is, in my opinion)—whether it refers to parental love as the “strongest thing,” or to \"the strongest person/s,” referring to the epic panel shown at the end of the chapter. However, when referring to the “strongest person,” the usual descriptive term would be written in kanji as “最強” (saikyō), rather than in hiragana as “いちばんつよい” (ichiban tsuyoi). In summary, there is still no official confirmation of what the “strongest” refers to in this chapter, but the simplified hiragana in the chapter title makes it feel as if it were written by a child. The children witnessed both their parents’/relatives’/teacher's strong and unconditional love for them—and they also saw how they were saved by Luffy and Loki at the end in their strongest forms. So personally, I think the title remains open to both interpretations.

      "text": "#ONEPIECE1174 Well, the only kanji in the WSJ title version is “1番” (ichiban – “number one”), and now the official version says it’s supposed to be written in pure hiragana—“いちばん.” This makes it much simpler, as if it were written from a child’s perspective. In my initial explanation, I focused on the “mono” (もの) part of the chapter title because it was written in hiragana instead of kanji. In Japanese, “mono” can be written using two different kanji: “物” (for non-living things) and “者” (for a person). I think it was intended that way to make the meaning ambiguous (and I still think it is, in my opinion)—whether it refers to parental love as the “strongest thing,” or to \"the strongest person/s,” referring to the epic panel shown at the end of the chapter. However, when referring to the “strongest person,” the usual descriptive term would be written in kanji as “最強” (saikyō), rather than in hiragana as “いちばんつよい” (ichiban tsuyoi). In summary, there is still no official confirmation of what the “strongest” refers to in this chapter, but the simplified hiragana in the chapter title makes it feel as if it were written by a child. The children witnessed both their parents’/relatives’/teacher's strong and unconditional love for them—and they also saw how they were saved by Luffy and Loki at the end in their strongest forms. So personally, I think the title remains open to both interpretations.
