The kids are no longer surrounded by Sommers' thorns.) Everyone: Huh? Ripley: Colon… where… are we? Colon: I don’t know!! But everyone’s alive!! Parent: Urgh… Kids: Mom! Luffy: It’s my Gomu Gomu no Hara Senbei (Gum Gum Belly Rice Cracker)!! It’s prickly, so hurry up and get off!! (It turns out the “solid ground” they fell onto was Luffy, who transformed himself into a giant rice cracker, resting on something enormous. LOL) Colon: Eh!? Luffy!? Loki: Hey, you guys!! Once we surface… get off my back immediately, got it?! You’ll just get in the way of my fight! Colon: Back?! Luffy: You guys just came falling down out of nowhere. Good thing we were passing by!! Loki: That was unintentional!! I’m a Destroyer!! I won’t guarantee anyone’s safety!! Here we go……!! (It turns out that the “something enormous” is Loki, and the mountains were actually spiky thorns on his back! We can see Loki’s eye completely, without the blindfold.) (At the Sun World, snow starts to fall and thunder starts to rumble.) Sommers: Snow? What's this all of a sudden? Thunder? (The trees at the Sun World starts to bounce.) Sommers: What the...?! The trees are bobbing...?! Jarul: This rhythm... Giant: Elbaph is shaking...!! Jarul: \"On a day of 'thundersnow,' a phenomenon so rare in this world...!!! A 'giant beast' appears, shrouding the sky... along with the 'Drums of Liberation'... Sommers: WHA...?! (ON THE EPIC FINAL DOUBLE PAGE OF THE CHAPTER, we can see Loki has transformed into an ENORMOUS black, winged dragon. Luffy is in his Gear 5 Gigant form, alongside Ragnir, who is in its squirrel form. No Devil Fruit name is revealed in this chapter.) (Lightning is striking down the MMAs below them.) Jarul: “The ‘Sun God’… shall appear!” Luffy: Ahyahyahya~~~!!! Ragnir: Kuriririri!!! Luffy: That’s hilarious!!! Look at how big you are!!! End Note: Elbaph, the time of liberation has come!!!

The kids are no longer surrounded by Sommers' thorns.) Everyone: Huh? Ripley: Colon… where… are we? Colon: I don’t know!! But everyone’s alive!! Parent: Urgh… Kids: Mom! Luffy: It’s my Gomu Gomu no Hara Senbei (Gum Gum Belly Rice Cracker)!! It’s prickly, so hurry up and get off!! (It turns out the “solid ground” they fell onto was Luffy, who transformed himself into a giant rice cracker, resting on something enormous. LOL) Colon: Eh!? Luffy!? Loki: Hey, you guys!! Once we surface… get off my back immediately, got it?! You’ll just get in the way of my fight! Colon: Back?! Luffy: You guys just came falling down out of nowhere. Good thing we were passing by!! Loki: That was unintentional!! I’m a Destroyer!! I won’t guarantee anyone’s safety!! Here we go……!! (It turns out that the “something enormous” is Loki, and the mountains were actually spiky thorns on his back! We can see Loki’s eye completely, without the blindfold.) (At the Sun World, snow starts to fall and thunder starts to rumble.) Sommers: Snow? What's this all of a sudden? Thunder? (The trees at the Sun World starts to bounce.) Sommers: What the...?! The trees are bobbing...?! Jarul: This rhythm... Giant: Elbaph is shaking...!! Jarul: \"On a day of 'thundersnow,' a phenomenon so rare in this world...!!! A 'giant beast' appears, shrouding the sky... along with the 'Drums of Liberation'... Sommers: WHA...?! (ON THE EPIC FINAL DOUBLE PAGE OF THE CHAPTER, we can see Loki has transformed into an ENORMOUS black, winged dragon. Luffy is in his Gear 5 Gigant form, alongside Ragnir, who is in its squirrel form. No Devil Fruit name is revealed in this chapter.) (Lightning is striking down the MMAs below them.) Jarul: “The ‘Sun God’… shall appear!” Luffy: Ahyahyahya~~~!!! Ragnir: Kuriririri!!! Luffy: That’s hilarious!!! Look at how big you are!!! End Note: Elbaph, the time of liberation has come!!!
