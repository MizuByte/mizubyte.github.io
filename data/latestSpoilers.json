THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! I once told myself I would keep doing what I could to help the manga industry take root in Morocco. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to reach that person. I plan to continue searching for a while. If you see this message, I hope you will contact me.",

After I posted that I was looking for this person, many people, like aspiring manga artists like him from Morocco, reached out with greetings. And many others also sent their encouragement. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH! I once told myself I would keep doing what I could to help the manga industry take root in Morocco. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to reach that person. I plan to continue searching for a while. If you see this message, I hope you will contact me.",
